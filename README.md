Lumi’s working experiences: 
I have over 4 years experience as a software product manager. 
I started in marketing, which taught me how to deeply understand customers and market needs.  
But I wanted to shape the product itself, so I moved into product management. 
Since then, I’ve worked on mobile payments, e-invoice SaaS, driving operation and growth for 
an e-commerce marketplace, the latest work I did was at a global crypto exchange to help them 
with user onboarding and risk prevention. My focus is  building products that improve 
customer experience while delivering business impact.
